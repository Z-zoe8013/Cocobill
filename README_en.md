:closed_book:A lightweight billing tool

In our daily life, We often don't know where money is spent on. But we are not really like to write it down on our account book to manage it.
When it comes to book-keeping, each of us has his own needs. It is must be an interesting thing, from my perspective, to develop an application for himself.

CocoBill is a billing tool, there are no unnecessary permissions, no advertisements, no user system, no information stored by the user, just a simple record of revenue and expenditure.

PS: Recently, many people have asked me about the data service. I used the server provided by Bmob. If you haven't heard of it, you can click there:https://www.bmob.cn/?invite_code=@qcg
or google it. It's easy to use and free for personal developers and small companies. The whole project is released on https://www.bmob.cn/shop/detail/448, and you will find it in your account after purchasing. Of course you can use the previous versions to use your own data service.
